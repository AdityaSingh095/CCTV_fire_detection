# Fire Detection Using Transfer Learning

This project implements a fire detection system using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 model and TensorFlow/Keras. It leverages a dataset from Kaggle, containing images classified as either "Fire" or "Non-Fire." The model is designed to effectively identify fire in real-time using CCTV footage or similar image sources.
